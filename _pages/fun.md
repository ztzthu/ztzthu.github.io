## Fun Facts

- I was born in Shanghai, China in 1999. My name in Chinese is 张 天 纵, which literally translates to "*globetrotter*".

- I participated in competitive science olympiad games during my high school. \
  I was a [gold medalist for the 2016 International Chemisty Olympiad (IChO)](http://www.icho-official.org/results/results.php?id=48&year=2016), and won 2nd prizes for both Chinese Maths & Physics Competition.

- I love taking challenges and pushing myself to the boundaries. Some of the highlights include:
  - In 2021 I shredded [my first 360 flat spin on skis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnyKjsWoEqM) in the very first ski season of my life.
  - In 2022 I travelled to the Northenmost point of Europe by public trasport all the way from Switzerland ([travelogue in Chinese](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Kc2PqQMSfLcBp7u8LG3IQg)).
  - In 2023 I [pedalled around Iceland](https://ztzthu.github.io/maps/#iceland) in 14 days on my road bike, before venturing into an erupting volcano on the Reykjanes Penisula.

- In the spare time I make maps as a hobby. Check out some of my maps [here](https://ztzthu.github.io/maps/) !
