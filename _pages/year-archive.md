I have a blog (in Chinese) that mostly records my adventures. The blog is only accessible via WeChat (a Telegram counterpart in China), but single posts can be accessed via web browsers. 

See some random posts about
- [a trip to Norway](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Kc2PqQMSfLcBp7u8LG3IQg), or
- [a boat trip on ~~the Geneva Lake~~ le Léman](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/gxtjvIpS1LCRdMwH_eg6tQ), or
- [the fun courses that I took during my bachelors](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/X_J98sBSTE7f4bHBKZcTCg).
